Types of Weight Distribution techniques:

Here I/P and O/P means number of Inputs and Outputs

1) Uniform Distribution: Here value Wij where i is hidden layer and j is unit in hidden layer is selected from a uniform distribution whose min value is -1/root of I/P
and max is 1/ root of I/P.

2)Xavier/Glora Initialization:
  Two Types:  
            1) Xavier Normal initialization from normal distribution where Wij is equivalent to N(0,σ) where σ = Root of (2/input + output)
            2) Xavier Uniform also from normal distribution but range is min = - (root 6)/ root input+output max = root 6)/ root input+output

3) Kaiming He Initialization:
  Two Types:
            1) He Normal initializatio same as above mut different range  Wij is equivalent to N(0,σ) where σ = Root of (2/input)
            2) He Uniform same as above type but range is min = - (root 6)/ root input max = root 6)/ root input

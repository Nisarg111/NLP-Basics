  a) The src directory is often used in software projects to organize source code. Placing your code in a src directory can help clarify the structure of your project,            making it easier to understand and navigate.
  b) The __init__.py file is used to mark a directory as a Python package. When a directory contains an __init__.py file, it tells Python that the directory should be             treated as a package, allowing you to import modules from that directory.

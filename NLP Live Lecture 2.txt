1. Corpus means a paragraph.
2. Document can be defined individual data points in a datasets or to be put simply we can say sentences.
3. Vocabulary no of unique words found in corpus.

Audio Classification Project:
IPython.display is used to play audio file and it takes file name and sample rate as arguments.
Librosa.display.waveplot(data,sampler_rate) is used to display graph.
Sample rate is the number of samples per second that are taken of a waveform to create a discete digital signal.
Audio sampling is the process of transforming a musical source into a digital file.
Librosa converts sterio channel to mono.
Librosa returns 2 Things sample rate and data.
Data are the wavepoints which can represented as an array of interger and it is normalized.
ANN Vs RNN
ANN cannot handle sequential data where position of an element is important for example if we pass it a sentence we convert it into a vector using BOW,Word2Vec which causes the information loss about the each words position.
Example when use google translate if have to process word sequentially to generate valid translations.


Difference Between ANN and Simple RNN:
ANN does not retain the information and all the inputs are passed in one timestamp i.e in one go.
In Simple RNN, its different, Every node in hidden layer contains a self loop or feedback loop and loop to other nodes in the hidden layer. When One node generates it output, this output is passed to itself and to other nodes. By doing this Simple RNN can retain previous information. Also inputs are passed once every time stamp.
